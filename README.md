# SMG-Before-the-Sequel-Public-Release
Hello and welcome to the SMG Before the Sequel Public Release Github Page! This page has 3 main functions.
1. Releases of the Mod! All releases (that aren't broken) will appear here!
2. Guides! Guides for Blue Coins, Stages, etc.
3. Discussions! This allows for players to suggest stuff for future stages! This is also where bugs will be reported!

As of August 4th, all stages are beatable and stars are collected! Please enjoy this mod!

And... this isn't over folks, World 2 is in development starting today!

If you want to stream or make videos about the mod, please leave a download link for it! This is greatly appreciated for literally any mod, not just mine!
