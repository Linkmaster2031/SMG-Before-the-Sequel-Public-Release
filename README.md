# SMG-Before-the-Sequel-Public-Release
Public Release of the Mod (Everyone can download this and play it)
The current version of the mod only has 6 stages, 1 hubworld, 3 bosses, and 28 stars. This mod also includes a bunch of custom code. Also I may have taken some objects and cameras from other mods.



Custom Code used:
SMG2 Boss Kameck Returns (Kamella Port)
Mid-Air Dive (Press the A button in the air)
Ground Pound Jump (Same as SMO)
Blue Coin System
Red Coin System
Custom Coin Spawns
SMG2 Boss Begoman Returns (Although not used, Topmaniac port)
A bunch of others that are syati related
Flying Star and Ice Flower (do i need to explain?) etc.

Please do not edit any stages in a stage editor and rerelease the mod. I am however okay with you looking inside of the stage editor to see how the stages are set up.
